   |   |_______- borrow might be used here, when `arena` is dropped and runs the `Drop` code for type `compact_arena::NanoArena`

   = note: values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are defined
   = note: this error originates in a macro outside of the current crate (in Nightly builds, run with -Z external-macro-backtrace for more info)

error: aborting due to previous error
